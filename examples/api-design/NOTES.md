# Curator Notes: API Design Example

## What Made This Debate Interesting

This example showcases how agents navigate the classic trade-off between simplicity and flexibility in API design.

## Key Trade-offs Discussed

1. **Rate Limiting Strategy**: Fixed window vs sliding window vs token bucket
2. **Pagination Approach**: Offset-based vs cursor-based pagination
3. **Error Response Format**: Simple strings vs structured error objects

## Why This Example Is Valuable

- Shows real-world API design decisions
- Demonstrates how agents justify their choices with concrete reasoning
- Illustrates convergence from different initial approaches

## How to Use This Example

Run the original task to see how your multi-turn planning compares:
```bash
/plan-with-multi-turn planning "Design REST API for user profile endpoint with rate limiting"
```
