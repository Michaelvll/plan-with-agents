# Curator Notes: Auth Flow Example

## What Made This Debate Interesting

Authentication involves security-critical decisions where agents must balance convenience against risk.

## Key Trade-offs Discussed

1. **Token Storage**: localStorage vs httpOnly cookies vs memory
2. **Refresh Token Rotation**: Single-use vs reusable with expiry
3. **Session Management**: Server-side sessions vs stateless JWT

## Why This Example Is Valuable

- Demonstrates security-focused reasoning
- Shows how agents handle compliance considerations
- Illustrates detailed threat modeling in multi-turn planning format

## How to Use This Example

Run the original task to see how your multi-turn planning compares:
```bash
/plan-with-multi-turn planning "Design authentication system with JWT refresh tokens"
```
