IMPROVE DISCOVERABILITY:\n   - Add more keywords to marketplace.json\n   - Add homepage field to plugin.json\n   - Create CHANGELOG.md\n\n5. DOCUMENTATION:\n   - Enhance README with examples, screenshots, troubleshooting\n   - Add CONTRIBUTING.md for open source\n\n6. CONSIDER AGENTS:\n   - Could create specialized subagents for different debate styles\n   - agents/quick-debate for fast consensus\n   - agents/thorough-debate for detailed exploration\n\nFocus on practical, implementable changes that will make this plugin professional and widely usable.",
